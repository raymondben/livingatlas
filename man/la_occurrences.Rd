\usage{
la_occurrences(taxon, wkt, fq, fields, extra, qa, method = "indexed", email,
  download_reason_id = la_config()$download_reason_id, reason,
  verbose = la_config()$verbose, record_count_only = FALSE,
  use_layer_names = TRUE, use_data_table = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{taxon}{string: (optional) query of the form field:value (e.g. "genus:Macropus") or a free text search (e.g. "macropodidae"). Note that
a free-text search is equivalent to specifying the "text" field (i.e. \code{taxon="Alaba"} is equivalent to \code{taxon="text:Alaba"}. 
The text field is populated with the taxon name along with a handful of other commonly-used fields, and so just specifying your target
taxon (e.g. taxon="Alaba vibex") will probably work. 
However, for reliable results it is recommended to use a specific field where possible (see \code{la_fields("occurrence_indexed")}
for valid fields). It is also good practice to quote the taxon name if it contains multiple words, for example
\code{taxon="taxon_name:\"Alaba vibex\""}}

\item{wkt}{string: (optional) a WKT (well-known text) string providing a spatial polygon within which to search, e.g. "POLYGON((140 -37,151 -37,151 -26,140.131 -26,140 -37))"}

\item{fq}{string: (optional) character string or vector of strings, specifying filters to be applied to the original query. These are of the form "INDEXEDFIELD:VALUE" e.g. "kingdom:Fungi". 
See \code{la_fields("occurrence_indexed",as_is=TRUE)} for all the fields that are queryable. 
NOTE that fq matches are case-sensitive, but sometimes the entries in the fields are 
not consistent in terms of case (e.g. kingdom names "Fungi" and "Plantae" but "ANIMALIA"). 
fq matches are ANDed by default (e.g. c("field1:abc","field2:def") will match records that have 
field1 value "abc" and field2 value "def"). To obtain OR behaviour, use the form c("field1:abc 
OR field2:def"). See e.g. \url{http://wiki.apache.org/solr/CommonQueryParameters} for more information about filter queries}

\item{fields}{string vector: (optional) a vector of field names to return. Note that the columns of the returned data frame 
are not guaranteed to retain the ordering of the field names given here. If not specified, a default list of fields will be returned. See \code{la_fields("occurrence_stored")} for valid field names with method \code{indexed}, and \code{la_fields("occurrence")} for valid field names with method \code{offline}. Field names can be passed as full names (e.g. "Radiation - lowest period (Bio22)") rather than id ("el871"). Use \code{fields="all"} to include all available fields, but note that \code{"all"} will probably cause an error with \code{method="offline"} because the request URL will exceed the maximum allowable length}

\item{extra}{string vector: (optional) a vector of field names to include in addition to those specified in \code{fields}. This is useful if you would like the default list of fields (i.e. when \code{fields} parameter is not specified) plus some additional extras. See \code{la_fields("occurrence_stored",as_is=TRUE)} for valid field names. Field names can be passed as full names (e.g. "Radiation - lowest period (Bio22)") rather than id ("el871"). Use \code{extra="all"} to include all available fields, but note that \code{"all"} will probably cause an error with \code{method="offline"} because the request URL will exceed the maximum allowable length}

\item{qa}{string vector: (optional) list of record issues to include in the download. Use \code{qa="all"} to include all available issues, or \code{qa="none"} to include none. Otherwise see \code{la_fields("assertions",as_is=TRUE)} for valid values}

\item{method}{string: "indexed" (default) or "offline". In "offline" mode, more fields are available and larger datasets can be returned}

\item{email}{string: the email address of the user performing the download (required for \code{method="offline"}}

\item{download_reason_id}{numeric or string: (required unless record_count_only is TRUE) a reason code for the download, either as a numeric ID (currently 0--11) or a string (see \code{\link{la_reasons}} for a list of valid ID codes and names). The download_reason_id can be passed directly to this function, or alternatively set using \code{la_config(download_reason_id=...)}}

\item{reason}{string: (optional) user-supplied description of the reason for the download. Providing this information is optional but will help to better support users by building a better understanding of user communities and their data requests}

\item{verbose}{logical: show additional progress information? [default is set by la_config()]}

\item{record_count_only}{logical: if TRUE, return just the count of records that would be downloaded, but don't download them. Note that the record count is always re-retrieved from the server, regardless of the caching settings. If a cached copy of this query exists on the local machine, the actual data set size may therefore differ from this record count. \code{record_count_only=TRUE} can only be used with \code{method="indexed"}}

\item{use_layer_names}{logical: if TRUE, layer names will be used as layer column names in the returned data frame (e.g. "watsonianViceCounties"). Otherwise, layer id value will be used for layer column names (e.g. "cl23")}

\item{use_data_table}{logical: if TRUE, attempt to read the data.csv file using the fread function from the data.table package. Requires data.table to be available. If this fails with an error or warning, or if use_data_table is FALSE, then read.table will be used (which may be slower)}
}
\value{
Data frame of occurrence results, with one row per occurrence record. The columns of the dataframe will depend on the requested fields
}
\description{
Retrieve occurrence data via the "occurrence download" web service. At least one of \code{taxon}, \code{wkt}, or \code{fq} must be supplied for a valid query. Note that there is a limit of 500000 records per request when using \code{method="indexed"}. Use the \code{method="offline"} for larger requests. For small requests, \code{method="indexed"} likely to be faster.
